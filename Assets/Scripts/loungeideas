a (rough) idea for more competitive rust arena matches

best of 9 rounds. spawns are swapped each round

kits are purchasable from vending machines at spawn during 30 second buy period.
each round begins automatically after 15 seconds. [no /ready, etc]


	weaponry						armor			meds		walls	cost
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0. crossbow, pipe, spear			wood armor		6 corn				default

1. revo, db, cleaver, beancan		buckethelmet 	6 corn	 		    200 
2. tommy, semi pistol, sword		hazzy 			4 meds				400 
3. sar, custom, ck					hazzy			4 meds		1		500 
4. m39, python, ck, f1 				roadsign 		6 meds		2		600 
5. mp5, m9, ck 						roadsign 		6 meds		3		700 
6. ak, bolt, jackhammer 			fullset 		6 meds		3		800 
7. m249, L9, jackhammer, smokes		fullset 		8 meds		3		1000



each player on winning team gains 300 scrap per round won
each player on losing team gains 200 scrap per round lost
suicide is a 100 scrap penalty.

a round is won by downing or full killing an entire enemy team.
round ends immediately when all players on one team are downed or full killed.

kits are lost on death and all gear and items are unlootable and non-transferable. ammo, armor, etc regenerate with each round survived.
all of a player's scrap can be taken (once per round) by looting their dead or downed body.


[optional rule for objective-based gameplay, speed things along a bit]
at the beginning of each round an airdrop spawns at a random location. it takes 2 minutes to drop. first team to loot it wins.
each player on the team who loots objective gains an extra 200 scrap in addition to the 200 for winning the round.


[another optional rule]
scrap bonuses awarded for each full kill, based on the weapon used:
spear - 100
cleaver - 75
combat knife - 60
jackhammer - 50
crossbow, pipe, revo - 60
double barrel - 50
tommy, semi pistol, sar, custom, python - 40
m39, m9, mp5 - 30
ak, bolt, l9, m249 - 25


ideally these rules or something like them will create a more interesting and competitive match which encourages gameplay that goes beyond bare tactics and into competitive strategies.
